msgid "In this pricing model, discount increases with the quantity of units sold. It means that the price per unit is dependent on the amount of items a shopper selects to purchase. For example, one unit costs $100, two—$80 each, five—$70, and so on"

msgid "For example, when a customer chooses one unit, the cost is the price tier for one, or $100. Selecting two units, the customer will pay $100 for the first unit and $80 for the second one. If the buyer chooses five units, the first will be $100, from the second to the fourth the cost will amount to $80, and the fifth one will be $70. Thus, the full price will be $410."

It will look like 7 units=(5 units *$70)+(2 units*$80)=$510."
